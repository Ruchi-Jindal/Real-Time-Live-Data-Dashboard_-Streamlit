# Real-Time-Live-Data-Dashboard_-Streamlit

First we need to setup the Conda environment. After setting the Conda, we can move forward to environment creation

## Create Environment with below command
### $ conda create -n stenv python=3.9
Where we are guiding conda to create environment with the name of "stenv" that uses Python 3.9 version

## Next we activate the environment
### $ conda activate stenv
## After activating the environment we run the streamlit installation command which is :
### $ pip install streamlit
## once the Streamlit is installed we can run the above python file to visulize the data:
### $ streamlit run app.py
