# Real-Time-Live-Data-Dashboard_-Streamlit

First we need to setup the Conda environment. After setting the Conda, we can move forward to environment creation

Create Environment with below command
$ conda create -n stenv python=3.9
Where we are guiding conda to create environment with the name of "stenv" that uses Python 3.9 version

Next we activate the environment
$ conda activate stenv
After activating the environment we run the streamlit installation command which is :
$ pip install streamlit
once the Streamlit is installed we can run the above python file to visulize the data:
$ streamlit run app.py
